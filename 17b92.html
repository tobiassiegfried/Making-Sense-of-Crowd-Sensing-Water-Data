However, due to the nature of the data acquisition tasks, e.g. morning and evening, if there is water in a canal, during irrigation season only until the next year etc., some form of long-term support and capacity building should ideally be in place.</div><div></div><div>From official sides, e.g. from Water Departments etc., there is often reluctance regarding the adoption of such new technologies because of lacking certification as well as non-conformance with existing WMO measurement standards. This points to additional requirements to work with these agencies at higher levels in conjunction with the WMO so as to ensure that top-level directives can be changed in the sense that they allow for the development of complementary measurement systems through the use of these technologies.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="836331" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h1><div>asdsa</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="567335" class="ltx_title_section">Bibliography</h1><div></div><div></div>
